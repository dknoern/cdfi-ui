              CDFI Explorer is a CDFI loan funds analytics tool, which enables
              subscribers to compare KPI historical trends of one or more CDFI
              loan funds against a peer group. Comparisons in charts and graphs
              or in tables can be exported as Excel worksheets for further
              analysis offline.
            </Typography.Paragraph>
            <Typography.Paragraph>
              Since the business models and operating environments of individual
              CDFI loan funds are diverse, comparisons should not be regarded as
              benchmarks.
